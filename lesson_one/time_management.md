There isn't an assignment besides reading some material and an article.
I think the best way to summarize the material would be to "get in the zone"
when programming. That is: set aside uninterrupted time to program.

The material and article provided talk about how it takes 30 minutes just
to start becoming productive. It reminds me of when I sit down to record music.

I can't just sit down for 30 minutes or an hour and make progress. Instead
it takes 30 minutes to tune my guitar, get warmed up, look over the project and 
previous recordings. Only then, can I actually start to create something worthwhile.
